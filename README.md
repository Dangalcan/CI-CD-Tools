# CI-CD-Tools

This is a repo that contains a tone of usefull CI/CD files to add to your projects. There are some folders where you can find nice templates and workflows to add to your project. Give them a try and include them in your repos to make them look more professional creating a stronger CI/CD flow.

In each folder you will have files to add to your .github folder.

Remember that:

1. You have to add workflows to .github/workflows in order to run them.
2. You have to add issue templates to /.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE in order to use the templates. Do not forget to enable issues in your repo.
3. Pull Request must be added to .github/ folder in order to use them.

Also take into account that you should check the templates to adapt some words such as "YourProjectName" or "YourEmail/Phone/Contact" in order to include your repo name and your project data.

If you want to use any special issues, please create labels first because otherwise it won't work. For example, create `information-requirement` label before introducing information-requirement template and workflow.
